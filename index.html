  <h1>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, what do you want? Well, we did do the nose. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. And the hat. She's a witch! How do you know she is a witch? He hasn't got shit all over him. We found them.

Be quiet! Shut up! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!

Well, we did do the nose. I dunno. Must be a king. Well, what do you want? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!

Well, what do you want? Well, how'd you become king, then? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, how'd you become king, then? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

We found them. Oh, ow! Bloody Peasant! What a strange person. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.

On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

You don't vote for kings. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Why? A newt?

You don't vote for kings. Burn her! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?

…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Be quiet! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! The nose? Camelot!
