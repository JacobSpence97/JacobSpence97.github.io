  <h1><b>History of BATMAN from wikipedia:</b></h1>
  <h2>Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.
    The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939).
    Originally named the "Bat-Man", the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective.
    Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises.
    After witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice.
    Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.
    Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City, with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin.
    Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers; rather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective skills, science and technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will.
    A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker.
    Batman became popular soon after his introduction in 1939 and gained his own comic book title, Batman, the following year.
    As the decades went on, differing interpretations of the character emerged.
    The late 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended.
    Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in 1986 with The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.
    The success of Warner Bros.' live-action Batman feature films have helped maintain the character's popularity.
    An American cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on various merchandise sold all over the world, such as toys and video games.
    The character has also intrigued psychiatrists, with many trying to understand the character's psyche.
    In May 2011, Batman placed second on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time, after Superman.
    Empire magazine listed him second in their 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time.
    The character has been portrayed in live-action adaptations by Lewis Wilson, Robert Lowery, Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale, and Ben Affleck.
    A number of voice actors have portrayed the character in animated adaptations over the years, including Olan Soule, Kevin Conroy, Will Friedle, Rino Romano, Diedrich Bader, and Jason O'Mara.

  <p><b> Of course what is BATMAN without his archenemy THE COLWN PRINCE OF CRIME himself THE JOKER!</b></p>
  <h1><b>History of THE JOKER from wikipedia:</b></h1>
  <h2>The Joker is a fictional supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman (April 25, 1940) published by DC Comics.
    Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution.
    Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.
    In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind.
    Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s.
    As Batman's nemesis, the Joker has been part of the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd, the second Robin and Batman's ward, and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon.
    The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances.
    The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane.
    The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.
    The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions, and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers.
    Although the Joker sometimes works with other supervillains such as the Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos.
    The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick.
    Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman.
    One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, the Joker has been listed among the greatest comic book villains and fictional characters ever created.
    The character's popularity has seen him appear on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspire real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and be referenced in a number of media.
    The Joker has been adapted to serve as Batman's adversary in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations, including the 1960s Batman television series (played by Cesar Romero) and in film by Jack Nicholson in <i>Batman</i> (1989), Heath Ledger in <i>The Dark Knight</i> (2008), and Jared Leto in <i>Suicide Squad</i> (2016).
    Mark Hamill, Troy Baker, and others have provided the character's voice.
